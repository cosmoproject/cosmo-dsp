# cosmo-dsp

The COSMO DSP library contains ready-made csound audio effects (DSP-Library/Effects) and the COSMO-Patcher.

The COSMO-Patcher is a tool to easily map and arrange the effects to the COSMO hardware boxes or a MIDI device. Based on a mapping file in JSON format (.json) a corresonding Csound (.csd) can be generated by the 'JsonToCsd.py' program.
